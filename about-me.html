        <section class="container about-content">
            <p>I am a political science PhD whose research life often revoles around theories and data, but pottery is where I slow down and work with my hands. My background in art goes back much further: I began painting at the age of three and have since explored a range of mediums. Over the years, I received formal training in <i>frottage</i> (stone rubbing) and <i>zhuangbiao</i> (Chinese-style framing), experimented with leatherwork and origami, and eventually found my lasting home in clay.</p>
            <p>Pottery, to me, brings together everything I love about making: the balance between control and surprise, form and texture, thought and intuition. I believe each piece should be unique and speak for itself. Every work carries its own story, whether an attempt to capture natural beauty or a quiet study of an artistic tradition that inspires me. When I am at the wheel or working by hand, I try to listen to the clay, the glze, and the small dialogue that unfolds between memory and material.</p>
